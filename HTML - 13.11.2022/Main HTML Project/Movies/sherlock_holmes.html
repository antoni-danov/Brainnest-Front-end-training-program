                <p>Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 period mystery action film starring Robert Downey Jr. as the character of
                    the same
                    name created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The film was directed by Guy Ritchie and produced by Joel
                    Silver,
                    Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey, and Dan Lin. The screenplay written by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony

                    Jude Law portrays Dr. John Watson. In 1890, eccentric detective Holmes and his companion Watson are
                    hired by
                    a secret society to foil a mysticist's plot to gain control of Britain by seemingly supernatural
                    means.
