    <div class="text-summary">
        <p>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a 2011 period mystery action film and the sequel to the 2009 film
            Sherlock Holmes, both which star Robert Downey Jr. as the titular character. The film is directed by Guy
            Ritchie and produced
            by Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey and Dan Lin. The film's screenplay was written by Michele
            Mulroney
            and Kieran Mulroney. Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprised their roles as Holmes and Watson, respectively,
            alongside Noomi
            Rapace as Simza, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty, and Rachel McAdams as
            Irene Adler.
            Although the film follows an original premise, it incorporates more closely elements of Conan Doyle's short
            stories,
            including "The Final Problem" (1893) and "The Adventure of the Empty House" (1903). In the film, Holmes and
            Watson
            travel across Europe with a Romani adventuress to foil an intricate plot by their cunning nemesis, Professor
            Moriarty, to instigate a major European conflict.</p>
