                <p>
                    I am a professional flute player. I started my journey at age of five and followed my studies in the
                    National School of Music in Sofia, Bulgaria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that I was addmited in the National Conservatory of Music - Sofia.
                    Through the years, I participated actively in many concerts, ceremonies, competitions and events and
                    I was
                    part of differents orchestras.
                </p>
                <p>In 2018, after a short break due to changes in place of living I finished my Master degree and in
                    2019 I
                    turned to my second passion in life the programming. Since, the classical music is transformed in a
                    hobby
                    for the moment.</p>
