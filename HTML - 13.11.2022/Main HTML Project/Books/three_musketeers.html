                <p>The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. The Three Musketeers tells the story of the early adventures
                    of the
                    young Gascon gentleman, D'Artagnan and his three friends from the regiment of the King's Musketeers
                    - Athos,
                    Porthos and Aramis. Under the watchful eye of their patron M. de Treville, the four defend the
                    honour of the
                    regiment against the guards of Cardinal Richelieu, and the honour of the queen against the
                    machinations of
                    the Cardinal himself as the power struggles of seventeenth century France are vividly played out in
                    the
                    background. But their most dangerous encounter is with the Cardinal's spy, Milady, one of
                    literature's most
                    memorable female villains, and Dumas employs all his fast-paced narrative skills to bring this
                    enthralling
                    novel to a breathtakingly gripping and dramatic conclusion</p>
